# Super Simple Stock Market
## Requirements
1. The Global Beverage Corporation Exchange is a new stock market trading in drinks companies.
   * Your company is building an object-oriented system to run that trading.
   * You have been assigned to build part of the core object model for a limited phase 1
2. Provide the complete source code that will:
   * For a given stock,
     * Given any price as input, calculate the dividend yield
     * Given any price as input,  calculate the P/E Ratio
     * Record a trade, with timestamp, quantity, buy or sell indicator and price
     * Calculate Volume Weighted Stock Price based on trades in past 5 minutes
   * Calculate the GBCE All Share Index using the geometric mean of the Volume Weighted Stock Price for all stocks
## Constraints & Notes
1. Written in one of these languages - Java, C#, C++, Python
2. The source code should be suitable for forming part of the object model of a production application, and can be proven to meet the requirements. A shell script is not an appropriate submission for this assignment.
3. No database, GUI or I/O is required, all data need only be held in memory
4. No prior knowledge of stock markets or trading is required â€“ all formulas are provided below.
5. The code should provide only the functionality requested, however it must be production quality.

## Implementation
### Summary
1. Solution implemented using C# 9.0, .NET Core 7.0
2. Unit test framework: xUnit 2.4.2, Moq 4.18.4, FluentAssertions 6.10.0
3. IDE: Visual Studio Code v1.77.1
4. Code documented with XML for C# documentation comments
### Solution Structure
- __SuperSimpleStockMarket__ - a library containing the implementation of all requirements listed above. This library is ready to be used as a part of a core object model or registered in a DI container as part of a RESTful Web API.
- __SuperSimpleStockMarket.Tests__ - Unit tests demonstrating that the __SuperSimpleStockMarket__ library meets the requirements.
### How To Run Unit Tests
1. Open the solution folder in Visual Studio Code and run the following Tasks:
   - _Terminal_ -> _Run Task..._ -> _build_
   - _Terminal_ -> _Run Task..._ -> _test_
2. Alternatively, unit tests can be executed using the `dotnet` CLI:
   - Open a terminal window
   - Navigate to the __SuperSimpleStockMarket.Tests__ folder
   - Run the following command from the command line: `dotnet test`
### Note
As stated in the requirements, there is no application or I/O for running the __SuperSimpleStockMarket__ functionality, except for the unit tests.
